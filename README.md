# Ensuring Your Technology Works Prior To Meetings

Tips and Tricks to help you ensure your technology is functional for work meetings.

## Introduction

Meetings are an integral part of communication in the workplace, and it is usually an expectation of employees to attend and participate in them. In the modern day, both due to unfortunate recent events as well as an increase in technological development, working from home and working from distributed offices have become an ever prevalent concept with a growing number of employees participating in this lifestyle. This, however, has come with the unfortunate side effect of establishing an expectation of employees to participate in virtual meetings and gatherings.

While the march of technological progression has an ever increasing pace, not all are able or care to keep up with it. Specializations in areas other than information technology usually leads to a lack of knowledge in the area, causing difficulty when expected to engage in the concept. 

This guide has been written to attempt to assist with ensuring your equipment is functional prior to meetings.
